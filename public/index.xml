      <description>Bibiana Toro, bmt897  R Markdown The two datasets that I have chosen include healthcare statistics for each county in the state of Texas. Data set 1 includes counties with different lifestyle choices such as percentage of people who drink, smoke, and their access to excersise in each county. Data set 2, then includes an overview of what is found in each county. For example, this data set includes the number of primary physicians per county as well as the population in each county.</description>

My dataset looks at information collected on Covid-19 throughout different counties in Texas. My variables include the counties themselves but also total Covid-19 positive cases and fatalities in each county. It also includes the population numbers for each county included, and whether they are considered Metro or non-Metro. Any county that is part of an MSA is classified as a metro area regardless of its own size.</description>
